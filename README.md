# noext - Extended Norwegian keyboard

This is an Extended Norwegian keyboard for Windows.
It allows you to write more accented characters, thorn and eth as well as some Sami characters will still using the Norwegian layout.
This is possible because a bunch of combinations are left un-used on the standard layouts as well as a lot of deadkey combinations not being defined.
E.g. AltGr+t and AltGr+d type þ and ð.

## KLC file

The KLC file slightly looks like it was hand-written but
it was actually generated using the program MSKLC.
Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator allows you to create or customise
keyboard layouts using a GUI and then install them.
It is very much recommended to use this file as a starting
point for your own custom layout so you get exactly the characters you often google to type.

If you have installed the keyboard with the installation files,
you don't need to download the KLC file to extend it.
You can choose from a list of installed keyboard layouts in
MSKLC instead of opening a KLC file.

## Installation

To use this, go into releases and download the most
recent installer from there. Alternatively, you can build
these files yourself using the KLC file and MSKLC as explained above.

## Usage and features

(To be explained, you probably were linked to this
by me on Discord, I'm willing to answer questions on there)
